CURRENT PLAN:
our current plan is to do a recipe/grocery shopping interface. We'll use an API to search through recipes, which someone can add to their grocery cart (rather than all the individual ingredients), then our program will combine all the like-ingredients so there's only one amount (so rather than 2 cups of milk, 5 cups of milk, 1 cup of milk, people will know they need eight cups - and maybe we'll convert that to 2 litres or something). We also want to be able to scale the number of servings of each of the recipes we add. There will also be an option to add what's already in your fridge, so you don't buy ingredients you already have enough of.

An additional idea we had was to include an option for nutrition facts for the recipes planned, and maybe have something where people can see some figures related to that - avg protein per meal, avg cals per day, we'd use another API if we do this

Additionally, one other possible idea was to make this a bit of a social app, so scrolling through people's recipes, savings theirs, adding your own, maybe sharing what you've been cooking lately (though i think data for nutritional info should be left private in my opinion)

Finally, another idea was to use some API for the prices of ingredients in your area (taken from somewhere, idk where, maybe an API, unsure), to have an estimated idea of how much your groceries will cost.

An extra idea I just thought of: but it could be nice to have some kind of calendar feature where you can actually plan where the meals are going (that way you know you have enough for a week, for example). This would also feed into the nutrition info section, or just stats in general, since we could should "your favourite breakfast last month" or "avg servings of vegetables at lunchtime" or something like that.

TIMELINE FEATURES:
1) recipe search
2) recipe to grocery list (view grocery list)
3) fridge inventory (changes grocery list)
4) adding recipes
5) calendar/meal planner
6) recipe search by ingredient/any other "searchables"
WE'LL SEE/PROBABLY NOT:
7) nutrition
9) budget + money saved OR personalized stats
10) eco friendly OR for you + social


NOTE: each directory now has a file called testing.java which is not used for our project - it's just here as a placeholder so i can push the directories to maintain the structure.
